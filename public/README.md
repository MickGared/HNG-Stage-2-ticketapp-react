# 🎫 Ticket Management Web App (React Version)

This is the **React implementation** of the Ticket Management Web Application challenge.  
It provides a complete frontend system for managing support tickets — featuring authentication, a responsive dashboard, and full ticket CRUD functionality — all with a clean, consistent UI.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Ticket Management App** allows users to:
- Create, edit, view, and delete support tickets.
- Log in and sign up securely (simulated authentication).
- View summary statistics on the dashboard.
- Toggle between light and dark modes.
- Stay authenticated using a simulated session token in `localStorage`.

This version was built entirely with **React**, following the same design and layout rules required for the React, Vue.js, and Twig implementations.
